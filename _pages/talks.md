During my second year at ESIR school, I made with 3 other students an project about saillance models and synamic blur for video games in unity. 
The objective was to build a saillance modèle usable in simple video game made with unity. 
We choose to work with post processing methodes that seems to be the the easiest way to insert blur in the modèle.
The choose to work with 2 images : one blured with simple convolution and the originale one. In a second step, we mix the 2 images based on a saillance map to creat the output frame.

Based on this methode, we propose 2 simple saillance modèles, one based on camera depth and distance to the center of the camera and a second one based a colorimetric saillance.

The second methode is the color based saillance.

This is the saillance map from the last image :
