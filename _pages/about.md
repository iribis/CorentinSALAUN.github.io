I am a PhD student at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Informatik under the supervision of Gurprit Singh. I am working on stochastic Monte Carlo integration methods and their application to light transport simulations.

My main interests are :
* Blue noise error distribution
* Multiple importance sampling
* Multi-class sampling
* General variance reduction tools for Monte Carlo
