The Mathematics Refresher Course is designed for first-year students to review and reinforce key mathematical concepts after the summer break. This course focus on essential topics such as derivatives, trigonometry, and functional analysis, providing a comprehensive review through targeted exercise sessions.

During this course I was in charge of 2 groups of students. Each group had 4 sessions of 1h45.
