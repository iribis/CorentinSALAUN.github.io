excerpt: 'We have developed a multi-class sampling framework based on optimal transport. To demonstrate its usefulness we tested it on several problems such as stippling, progressive sampling or objects placement. Finally, we have reformulated the problem of integration error distribution for rendering as a multi-class sampling problem. This allowed us to define an error bound that once minimized naturally distributes the error as blue noise.'
